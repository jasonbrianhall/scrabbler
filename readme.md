Scrabbler is a python program designed to cheat at Scrabble or other word games.

Software takes in two arguments, letters and the length of the word.  If the letter is upper, it treats it as a set place (meaning that character must be in the nth place of the word).  Currently the software reads from linux.words.  Future enhancement would be to get common words (as listed by Google) verses uncommon words and display the common words toward the end of the list.
